# Java-Code-Showcase
This repository is designed to show some of my Java projects/tasks done within school projects and outside of school to any potential employers!

# Table of Contents
This repository consists of 3 interconnected files that create an order system for children's toys. Child.java will manage a collection/list of toys (since each child owns their own toys) and an order system will create an order containing up to 5 children.

# Thank you for checking out my code!
