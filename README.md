# Java-Code-Showcase
This repository is designed to show some of my Java projects/tasks done within school projects and outside of school to any potential employers!

# Table of Contents
This repository consists of 3 interconnected files that create an order system for children's toys.

Child.java - manages information about a single child. This class contains the name and age of the child, along with the list of toys the child wants and the number of toys the child has at any given moment.

Order.java - manages information about a single order. This class contains the list of children in the order and the number of children at any given moment.

Toy.java - manages information about a single toy. This class contains the ID, name, quantity, and price of the toy.
